"""Classes and functions related to MAVLink networks, i.e. a set of MAVLink
connections over which the system IDs of the devices share the same namespace.

For instance, a Skybrush server may participate in a MAVLink network with two
connections: a wifi connection and a fallback radio connection. The system ID
of a MAVLink message received on either of these two connections refers to the
same device. However, the same system ID in a different MAVLink network may
refer to a completely different device. The introduction of the concept of
MAVLink networks in the Skybrush server will allow us in the future to manage
multiple independent MAVLink-based drone swarms.
